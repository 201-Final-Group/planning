## Cooperation

Pair proramming task-by-task.  Group think to start and end day, or when otherwise needed.  Then split into pairs and tackle our given task.

## Conflict Resolution

Speak up if we have an issue or something upsets us.  Communicate.  De-escalate if needed.  Be open and approachable, don't thake things personal. Taking breaks and stepping away! 

Pair programming and talking through the code will mitigate if someone doesn't understand a concept.  Talk through our code and bring up questions in our group meets.

Culitvating an attitude and culture of "safe-space" and fun while learning. Open conversation and mutual respect.

## Communication Plan

Slack will be our primary means for day-to-day. Github can be as needed. Understanding each others schedules will help. Factoring in rest and recovery to help productivity.  Take breaks every hour.  If we fall behind, we may have to reassess our goals.  Having realistic goals.  After hours and weekend communication will be done through slack as well.  We'll have roundtable discussions as we are currently doing to make sure everyones voice is being heard.  Being respecful will be a way to keep our group open and safe.

## Work Plan

Pair programming. Breaking tasks down to their smallest bits and accomplish them one at a time. Possibly a task tracking software to keep track of who is doing what.  Normal flow of discussion and be clear about what we are doing that day and working on. 

## Git Process

Merges will need to be reviewed by 2 people. Mob programming to start so we are on same understanding of basic HTML layout and structure. Often ACP's. Navigator reminding driver to commit regularly.
