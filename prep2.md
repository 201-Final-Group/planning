## Creating a Pitch

* Land, Fire, Water
  <ol> 
    <li>A rock paper scissors variant where you  play against a computer.  </li>
    <li> This is meant to kill time and provide entertainment for a short period. Imagine if you will need to take a break form a long coding session and you donâ€™t have a lot of time. You can just hop in the app play a few rounds and brain a break. </li>
    <li>MVP: A rock paper scissor game with an interface that interacts with a scoreboard  </li>
  </ol>



* Calender (TBA)
  <ol> 
    <li>An easy UI where you can organize your day in a professional setting. </li>
    <li>This is a personal organizer that will make it easier to plan events laid out on a calendar. Using a form, you will be able to add events to a calendar for better time keeping. </li>
    <li>MVP: A calendar where you can add events through a form with a constructor functions with new instances </li>
  </ol>
